# OpenVolanta

An open source alternative to the Volanta flight sim tracker plugins

## Projects

- [packet](packet) - A packet sniffer for Volanta
- [XPlane](XPlane) - A plugin for X-Plane that allows you to track your flights without using the proprietary plugin
- [LandingRate](LandingRate) - A modified version of the FlyWithLua LandingRate plugin that sends landing data to Volanta instead of using their plugin's (unreliable) info
