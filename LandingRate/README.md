# OpenVolanta LandingRate

A modified version of the [FlyWithLua LandingRate plugin](https://forums.x-plane.org/files/file/43586-a-new-landing-rate-display/) that sends landing data to Volanta instead of using their plugin's (unreliable) info

> [!NOTE]
> Using this plugin with the original Volanta plugin will result in the landings being registered twice. It is recommended to use OpenVolanta's plugin instead.

## Installation

1. Download FlyWithLua NG
2. Download the LandingRate.lua file
3. Copy the LandingRate.lua file into the FlyWithLua NG Scripts folder
